# Save-the-King-Chess

**Not your normal full mode chess**

Made entirely using Programming Fundamentals concepts, so very straight forward and easy to understand for beginners in C++

There are two modes to this game

Mode 1
. This is where you choose your desired chess piece, and then enter the row and column number to get the possible movements of that piece from the initial position

Mode 2
. This is a two player game. One player chooses a desired chess piece, while the other defends the King. The game ends when the King falls.

The GUI is pretty simple, yet captivating. No GUI library like SFML was used, and can be played entirely on console.
